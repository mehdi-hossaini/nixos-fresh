# Claude Code's *rules* — the editor guard and the convention hook — are
# configuration, so they are declared here rather than hand-written into the home
# directory. Claude Code reads /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json ahead of
# ~/.claude/settings.json and wins on conflict, which is what makes this the right
# half of the split: settings.json stays writable for state (theme, dialogs) while
# the rules come from the repo and survive a reinstall.
#
# The instructions themselves (CLAUDE.md) and the convention checker are declared
# in modules/home — they belong to the user, not the system.
